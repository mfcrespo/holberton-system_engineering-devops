# 0x18. Webstack monitoring

## Background Context

You cannot fix or improve what you cannot measure is a famous saying in the Tech industry. In the age of the data-ism, monitoring how our Software systems are doing is an important thing. In this project, we will implement one of many tools to measure what is going on our servers.

Web stack monitoring can be broken down into 2 categories:

Application monitoring: getting data about your running software and making sure it is behaving as expected
Server monitoring: getting data about your virtual or physical server and making sure they are not overloaded (could be CPU, memory, disk or network overload)

##Tasks

0. Sign up for Datadog and install datadog-agent
For this task head to https://www.datadoghq.com/ and sign up for a free Datadog account. When signing up, youll have the option of selecting statistics from your current stack that Datadog can monitor for you. Once you have an account set up, follow the instructions given on the website to install the Datadog agent.

1. Monitor some metrics
Among the litany of data your monitoring service can report to you are system metrics. You can use these metrics to determine statistics such as reads/writes per second, which can help your company determine if/how they should scale. Set up some monitors within the Datadog dashboard to monitor and alert you of a few. You can read about the various system metrics that you can monitor here: System Check.

2. Create a dashboard
Now create a dashboard with different metrics displayed in order to get a few different visualizations.
